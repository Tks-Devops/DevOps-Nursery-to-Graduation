# Real-World Scenario: Maven in a Spring Boot Project

## Scenario Overview
Company TK is developing a web application called **MyWebApp** using Java and the Spring framework. The application consists of multiple modules and relies on external libraries and dependencies. The development team wants to use **Maven** to manage the build process and handle dependencies effectively.

### How Maven is Used in This Scenario:

1. **Project Setup**: The team creates a new Maven project for **MyWebApp** using Maven's project archetype. They define the project structure and configuration files such as `pom.xml`, which acts as the core configuration for the Maven project.

2. **Dependency Management**: The team specifies project dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. Maven automatically resolves and downloads required dependencies from remote repositories, streamlining dependency management.

3. **Build Automation**: The team configures build settings and plugins in `pom.xml`. Maven handles tasks such as:
   - Compiling source code
   - Running tests
   - Generating documentation
   - Packaging the application into executable formats like JAR or WAR

4. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The team integrates Maven with a **CI/CD system** such as **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**. The CI system monitors the version control repository (e.g., Git), triggering automated builds whenever a new commit is made.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Maven integrates with testing frameworks like **JUnit** and **Mockito**. The team writes unit tests and configures Maven to execute these tests during the build process. Additionally, Maven plugins are used for **static code analysis, code coverage, and other quality checks**.

6. **Deployment and Release Management**:
   - Maven creates a deployable package (e.g., WAR file) with all necessary dependencies.
   - The team uses Maven to deploy the package to application servers such as **Tomcat, JBoss**, or **cloud platforms like AWS**.
   - They also push the built artifacts to a **Nexus repository** for sharing across development environments.

7. **Dependency Updates**: Maven simplifies updating project dependencies. Developers can use Maven commands to check for the latest library versions and resolve compatibility issues automatically.

# Maven Build Lifecycle
Maven has **three primary build lifecycles**:

### 1. Clean Lifecycle
Removes build output generated from previous builds.
- `mvn clean`: Deletes compiled files and target directories.

### 2. Default Lifecycle (Main Build Process)
- **validate**: Ensures the project structure is correct.
- **compile**: Compiles source code.
- **test**: Runs unit tests.
- **package**: Packages compiled code into JAR/WAR.
- **install**: Installs the package into the local repository (`.m2` folder) for use in other projects.
- **deploy**: Pushes the package to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus) for sharing with other teams.

### 3. Site Lifecycle
Generates project documentation and reports.
- `mvn site`: Generates documentation.
- `mvn site-deploy`: Deploys the generated documentation to a web server.

# Common Maven Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mvn compile` | Compiles the project's source code. |
| `mvn test` | Runs unit tests. |
| `mvn package` | Creates a JAR/WAR package. |
| `mvn install` | Installs the package into the local repository. |
| `mvn deploy` | Deploys the package to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus). |
| `mvn site` | Generates project documentation. |
| `mvn site-deploy` | Deploys documentation to a web server. |
| `mvn clean` | Cleans up previous build outputs. |

## Conclusion
Maven streamlines **build, dependency management, testing, and deployment** in Java projects. It ensures consistency across environments and automates repetitive tasks, making it an essential tool for modern development teams.



# Maven Workflow for a Spring Boot Project

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- Java 17 (or required version for your project)
- Apache Maven
- A Spring Boot project set up

## Step 1: Verify Maven Installation
Run the following command to check if Maven is installed:
```sh
mvn -version
```
This should display the installed Maven version and Java version.

## Step 2: Create a Spring Boot Project
If you haven't already created a project, generate one using:
```sh
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=com.example \
    -DartifactId=my-springboot-app \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DinteractiveMode=false
```
Alternatively, you can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a project.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory
```sh
cd my-springboot-app
```

## Step 4: Build the Project
To compile the project and check for errors, run:
```sh
mvn compile
```

## Step 5: Run Tests
To execute unit tests:
```sh
mvn test
```

## Step 6: Package the Application
To package the project into a JAR file:
```sh
mvn package
```
The generated JAR file will be located in the `target/` directory.

## Step 7: Run the Spring Boot Application
Execute the JAR file using:
```sh
java -jar target/my-springboot-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Step 8: Clean the Project (Optional)
To remove compiled files and reset the build:
```sh
mvn clean
```

## Step 9: Install the Artifact Locally
To install the JAR file into the local Maven repository:
```sh
mvn install
```

## Step 10: Deploy to a Remote Repository (Optional)
If deploying to a repository like Nexus or Artifactory, configure your `pom.xml` and use:
```sh
mvn deploy
```

## Conclusion
This workflow covers the essential Maven commands for building, testing, packaging, and running a Spring Boot project. You can extend this process with additional plugins and configurations based on your project requirements.
